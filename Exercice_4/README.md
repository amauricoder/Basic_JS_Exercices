**4. Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6,**

Calculate the area of a triangle of three given sides :
In geometry, Heron's formula named after Hero of Alexandria, gives the area of a triangle by requiring no arbitrary choice of side as base or vertex as origin, contrary to other formulas for the area of a triangle, such as half the base times the height or half the norm of a cross product of two sides.

The Math.sqrt() function is used to get the square root of a number. If the value of the number is negative, Math.sqrt() returns NaN.
